# mongoDB-nodejs-driver-demo
a demo for **mongoDB** api in nodejs , it's just like a reference for **mongoDB pkg** api .

to lean **mongoDB** from scratch i recomend to check the [mongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).


> the code will not work unless you start a mongoDB connection and change the ip/port if needed .

# usage
